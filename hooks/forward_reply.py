"""Forward a finished reply to the Discord thread that asked for it.

Wired to Claude Code's **Stop** hook, which fires once when a turn ends and
hands over `transcript_path` on stdin.

Why this exists
---------------
A conversation that arrived from Discord used to be answered twice: once as the
argument to `zipper discord send`, and once as the session's own reply into the
terminal that nobody was reading. That is the same words through the model
twice -- measured at **44% of the paired output** on 2026-09-06 -- to say one
thing to one person.

It also asked the session to decide, every turn, which surface it was talking
to. It got that wrong eight times in a row that day, replying to Discord for
messages that had been typed at the keyboard, because the only marker was on
the *first* message of the session and it generalised from there. A decision
made from ambient context every turn is a decision that will drift.

So the session no longer decides and no longer sends: it writes one reply, and
this decides where that reply goes.

The rule
--------
Post if the turn was *started* from Discord. The bot records what it delivered
(`conversations.note_delivery`), and the last user message in the transcript is
compared against that record. A match means the bot put it there; anything else
means they typed it, and the terminal already showed them the answer.

The comparison is against the **last** user message rather than the first,
because that is the one that started this turn -- a conversation can begin on a
phone and continue at the keyboard, and each turn is routed on its own.

Rules that matter
-----------------
- **Always exit 0.** A non-zero exit from a Stop hook is not advisory: exit code
  2 *prevents the turn ending* and feeds stderr back to the model. A Discord
  outage must not trap a session in a loop, so every failure here is swallowed.
  Silence is the correct failure mode -- the terminal still has the answer.
- **Dedupe on the assistant message uuid.** The hook can fire more than once for
  a turn; forwarding is not idempotent from Discord's side.
- **Skip `local-` threads.** `new_conversation()` falls back to a local id when
  Discord is unreachable, precisely so a conversation can still start without
  it. There is no thread to post to, and that is not an error.
- **Wait for the closing row before reading the reply.** Stop fires while Claude
  Code is still appending the final assistant message, so the answer is often
  not on disk yet -- see `main`.
- **A turn can be prompted by more than one message.** Provenance is asked of
  all of them, not only the last -- see `read_turn`.

    every turn looked like it came from the terminal.

    Returns `(last_user, reply, uuid, closed, turn_users)`.

    `closed` says whether the turn's final assistant row -- the one whose
    `stop_reason` is *not* `tool_use` -- is on disk yet. The hook fires and
    reads the file in the same second Claude Code is appending that row, so the
    answer is sometimes not there; `main` waits for it. Without the wait the
    hook reads a turn whose reply is still empty, logs `empty turn`, and returns
    -- the reply is then never forwarded at all, because Stop does not fire
    twice. That is what ate five replies on the morning of 2026-09-16.

    `turn_users` is **every** prompt this turn is answering, not just the last.
    The opening message starts the turn; anything they send while it runs arrives
    as an `enqueue` and is answered by the same turn. They do not all come
    through the same door -- a turn opened from Discord can be added to from the
    dashboard -- so "did this turn come from Discord?" cannot be answered from
    the most recent message alone, and answering it that way sent a Discord
