/* Canvas planner items -- the only source that knows submitted vs due.
 *
 * Why this is a content script and not a background fetch
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * It has to run *in the page*. `canvas_session` is a SameSite cookie, so a
 * request issued from the extension's own background context is cross-site and
 * the browser would leave the cookie behind -- Canvas then answers with the SSO
 * login page, at status 200, and the caller happily parses a login form as an
 * empty planner. From here the request is same-origin and the session rides
 * along exactly as it does for Canvas' own JavaScript.
 *
 * That is the same trick `/bookmarklet` has always used, which is the point:
 * this is a proven request being made automatically instead of by hand. The
 * server endpoint it posts to is the one the bookmarklet already talks to.
 *
 * The cost of doing it this way is honest and worth stating: it only runs while
 * they have Canvas open. Nothing here can make the data fresher than their browsing.
 * Zipper is told when the reading was taken so it can say how old it is, rather
 * than implying a currency it does not have.
 */
/* Wrapped, because every content script on a page shares one global scope.
 *
 * Chrome and Firefox give an extension a single isolated world per frame, not
 * one per file, so two content scripts that both say `const api = ...` at top
 * level are two declarations of the same binding -- and the second one does not
 * merely lose, it throws `Identifier 'api' has already been declared` and the
 * whole file never evaluates. It fails at line 1, before any of its own code
 * runs, so the symptom is a script that is plainly listed in the manifest and
 * plainly does nothing.
 *
 * `node --check` cannot see it: each file is valid alone and the collision only
 * exists once the browser has loaded both. So the fix is structural rather than
 * a rename -- a closure per file means the README's "adding a site is one file
 * plus a content_scripts entry" stays true no matter what the next file calls
 * its variables.
