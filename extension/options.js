/* One setting: where Zipper is.
 *
 * The address is a runtime permission rather than a manifest entry. A personal
 * tailnet host has no business in a manifest that lives in a public repo, and
 * asking for every-https-host up front would be a far broader grant than the
 * one host actually needed. So the manifest declares it optional and this asks
 * for exactly the origin they typed, at the moment they type it.
 *
 * (The wildcard pattern is spelled out in manifest.json, not here: a literal
 * star-slash inside a block comment ends the comment. It did, once.)
