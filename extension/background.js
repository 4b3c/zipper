 * knows one website and returns JSON; adding a site is writing one content
 * script, never touching this. That split is the whole design -- the browser is
 * a place to *read* things a logged-out server cannot, and nothing more. No
 * parsing, no judgement, no vault knowledge. The backend concludes.
 *
 * Written for Chrome's service worker, which is the stricter of the two: it is
 * killed aggressively and keeps no globals between wake-ups. So there is no
 * module-level mutable state here -- every fact that has to outlive a message
 * lives in chrome.storage. Firefox runs the same file as an event page, where
 * that discipline is merely unnecessary rather than wrong. Code written the
 * other way round breaks on Chrome, which is why the constraint is honoured
 * even though half the targets do not need it.

 * -- a field that flaps between two values, or two tabs loading together, both
 * finding no stored hash and both deciding to send. It only gates
