    and left the evidence in the same place: a rendering of what a terminal
    looked like for a moment.

    The transcript is Claude's own record. If a user row appeared, the session
    received the message; if none did, it did not, whatever the pane showed.
    That is not a better heuristic, it is a different kind of fact, which is
    why this is the last word rather than another frame check.

    **`type: "user"` is not the same as "a message".** Claude Code writes every
    tool result as a user row too, so a session that is merely *working* grows
    this count on its own, every few seconds, with nothing delivered. Counting
    the substring therefore answers "is this session busy", not "did my message
    arrive" -- and the two are indistinguishable at exactly the moment they
    differ, because a message sent into a working session is the case where a
    tool result is most likely to land first.

    That cost three messages on 2026-09-16. A rewrite made this the *sole*
    confirmation that a paste had been delivered; two of them went into sessions
    mid-turn, a tool result ticked the counter within half a second, and
    `paste()` reported success over text still sitting in the input box. The
    caller logged `200`, and the thread stayed silent. It was survivable in the
    older code only because the pane checks ran first, so a false increment
    could never manufacture a success by itself.

    So: real user turns only. Tool results carry a `tool_result` block, and a

    through `convhead` would deliver the text to the session while the terminal
    on screen showed nothing happening, which is worse than either option.

    `_input_line`, `_await_recorded` -- exists only to serve this function, and

    **This is the only record of where a message came from, and it lives here

    session never needs to know its own provenance -- and a tag in the prompt
    would be a fact about one past turn sitting in the context window forever,
    misrouting every later turn. (It did: HISTORY.md, 2026-09-06.)

    Something still has to know, because the terminal is the other input and it
    produces no event anyone can observe: Abram typing into the pane is invisible
    to the bot, to this process, and to systemd. So provenance is recorded at the
    one moment it is unambiguous -- delivery -- and the Stop hook answers "did
    this turn come from Discord?" by comparing the transcript's last user message
    against this. A match means the bot put it there; anything else means he
    typed it.

    **It is a set, not a slot.** A single `last_delivered` assumed one message
    in flight at a time, and a conversation does not work that way: he sends a
    follow-up while a long turn is still running, delivery overwrites the slot,
    and when the *first* turn ends the hook compares its prompt against the
    *second* message's key, decides it was typed, and drops the reply. That is
    exactly what happened on 2026-09-08 -- an eight-minute bookkeeping pass
    answered into a terminal nobody was reading while he waited on Discord.

    So every delivery is remembered, not just the newest. The list is bounded
    two ways, because an unbounded provenance log is its own bug: `KEEP` entries,
    and `TTL` seconds. Both exist to stop a key outliving the conversation it
    describes -- a message from this morning still matching at midnight would
    forward a reply to something he typed at the keyboard hours later.
