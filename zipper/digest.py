"""zipper.digest

The evening message: what is due tomorrow, what is on the calendar, and what
is coming after that. Posted to Discord by `zipper-digest.timer`.

**It reads through `zipper.web.data`, not through the JSON.** The ranking, the
cross-offs and the class links are the dashboard's, so a digest and the *What
to work on* card cannot disagree about what is outstanding -- two components
answering the same question differently is the bug class this system keeps
rediscovering, and a nightly message is the worst place to find it, because
there is nothing on screen next to it to contradict.

It concludes nothing and writes nothing to the vault. It is a reminder.
