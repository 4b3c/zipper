"""Dashboard server for the vault.

Design notes, 2026-09-01:
  * every page load serves the LAST CACHED state instantly -- never a spinner
  * a refresh of the external sources is kicked off in the background
  * the page shows, per source, how old its data is, so staleness is visible
    rather than silent. Every bug this vault has produced was stale data
    presented as current.

    python3 -m zipper.serve --port 8800

**This file is the entry point, not the server.** The server lives in
`zipper/web/`, one module per concern, because this file reached 2,788 lines
and no part of it could be read without loading all of it:

    web/base.py     shared imports, the PATH repair, STATE, source freshness
    web/data.py     what the panels are made of -- days, tasks, ranking, flags
    web/feed.py     the queue, the SSE bus, and the refresh
    web/conv.py     conversations as the page sees them; the terminal card
    web/css.py      the stylesheet, as a literal
    web/js.py       the browser code, as literals
    web/render.py   the /views, /tasks and /canvas pages
    web/http.py     routing, the JSON API, and main()

They import in that order and the dependencies run one way, so any one of them
can be read on its own.

Everything is re-exported here, because `from . import serve` and
`python3 -m zipper.serve --mark <key>` are used by the CLI, by `runqueue.py`
and by the reply-forwarding hook. Moving code between modules must not change
what those see.
