"""
The GitHub App identity - how Zipper acts on GitHub as itself.

Before this existed, everything Zipper did on GitHub borrowed Abram: his personal
token in `.env`, reaching all 144 repos including the 65 NDA'd ASU-LL ones, with
every commit and every push indistinguishable from him at a keyboard. The App is a
separate actor - a `<slug>[bot]` account with its own profile and its own noreply
address, and no square on his contribution graph.

Two credentials, and the difference matters:

  the private key   long-lived, on disk, and ONLY able to mint tokens
  an install token  what actually touches the API - expires in an hour

So the secret at rest is not a key to the account; it is a key to a one-hour,
one-permission lease - `contents: write`, and nothing else, on whatever the
installation covers. `GITHUB_TOKEN` stays in `.env` because `zipper github` reads
144 repos across an org the App is not installed on; fetching is still his. This
module is about *writing*.

The installation is deliberately account-wide rather than one repo: Zipper is
meant to work across his projects, not just its own. That trades the narrowest
possible blast radius for reach, knowingly. What it does NOT trade away is the
org: the App is installed on his personal account, so no ASU-LL repo is reachable
with this token under any circumstance.

RS256 is signed by shelling out to
`openssl`, which is already on the box, rather than taking a `cryptography`
dependency for one signature every hour.
