"""zipper.canvas

Canvas planner items -- the only source that knows submitted vs due.

**Nothing in this file talks to Canvas.** It parses a reading the browser has
already taken and hands the result to the vault. That is a deliberate amputation
(2026-09-08), not a gap waiting to be filled:

Many schools issue students no Canvas API token, so the fetcher ran on a
`canvas_session` cookie copied by hand into `.env`. A copied cookie starts dying
the moment it is taken -- one school rotated it twice inside one day on 2026-09-06 --
while the identical session inside a browser never dies, because the browser
renews it through SSO unasked. Nothing was ever wrong with the request; only the
credential's lifetime failed. So the request moved to where the credential
already lives, and only the answer crosses the network. See `extension/`.

What follows from that, and is worth not re-litigating: there is no
`CANVAS_TOKEN` path, no `CANVAS_SESSION` path, and no auth error to handle,
because there is no credential here that could be wrong. `ingest()` is the
single write path, reached from `POST /api/canvas` or `zipper canvas --file`.

# Crossing something off by hand
#
# **Canvas is not always right about what is done.** CSE 434's homework lives on
# PrairieLearn, an optional extra-credit item is one they have decided not to do --
# in both cases Canvas says `submitted: false` forever and is not going to change
# its mind. The operator's word is the better evidence, and this is where it is kept.
#
# The hard requirement is that it **survives a re-read**. The extension rewrites
# `canvas.json` wholesale every time they open Canvas, so an override that lived
# on the item itself would be erased by the next visit and the finished homework
# would come back as outstanding -- which is exactly what it did.
#
# So overrides live beside the data rather than in it, and an item is matched
# back to its override two ways:
#
#   * **by key** -- course plus normalized title, so a re-read finds it again
#   * **by `plannable_id`** -- so an item that gets *retitled* stays crossed off
#
# Either match is enough. Between them, a crossed-off assignment reconnects to
# its own cross-off however Canvas chooses to re-describe it.
#
# **This is a display override and never a submission.** Nothing here is sent to
# Canvas, and nothing here makes a deadline go away.
