"""zipper -- a queryable model of one person's work.

The package is split by concern; `core` holds the vault paths, the frontmatter
reader and the handful of helpers everything shares.

`core.TODAY` is deliberately read through the module rather than imported by
value: the server is long-running and re-reads it at midnight, and a `from core
import TODAY` would pin a stale date that only misbehaves after a rollover.
