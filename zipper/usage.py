"""zipper.usage

How much of the plan is left: the 5-hour session window and the 7-day window,
as percentages, for the meters under the dashboard's chat list.

**Nothing local can answer this.** The transcripts on this box know how many
tokens *this* box spent, but not the denominator, and not what was spent from
the phone or the laptop. The only honest source is Anthropic's own OAuth usage
endpoint, which is what Claude Code's own `/usage` reads.

That means a token, and the token is Claude Code's. It is read out of
`~/.claude/.credentials.json` at call time and **never stored, logged or
written anywhere** -- `Inbox/usage.json` holds the percentages and nothing
else. Same rule as `.env`: credentials stay where they are.

The response shape is not a contract we control, so `_pct` hunts for the number
rather than indexing a path. A shape change should show up as a blank meter,
never as a wrong one -- an authoritative-looking 12% when the truth is 90% is
the failure worth designing against.
