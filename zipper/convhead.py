"""Delivering a message without a terminal.

The same job as `convcore.paste`, against Claude Code's headless protocol
instead of its TUI. Nothing here captures a pane, and nothing here guesses.

**Why this exists.** `paste()` drives a conversation by typing at a rendering of
one, and a rendering has no commit point: a redraw mid-frame and a real state
change look identical in a capture. That is one bug, and it has been fixed three
times in three shapes -- a window too short (2026-09-07), a check reading a line
the text was never on (2026-09-09), a box that filled and then emptied without
Claude ever seeing the message (2026-09-10) -- plus a fourth when the transcript
counter was made the sole witness and a tool result ticked it (2026-09-16). Each
fix made the reader sharper and left the evidence in the same place.

`claude -p --input-format stream-json --output-format stream-json` has the
commit points the screen lacks, and they are the exact four things `paste()`
infers:

    convcore.py                        here
    -----------------------------------------------------------------
    _wait_ready   prompt char drawn    the process accepts stdin
    _await_echo   box looks non-empty  the `user` event, echoed by
                                       --replay-user-messages
    _submit       box cleared twice    writing the line *is* the submit
    _await_recorded  transcript grew   the `result` event

So the two failure modes that cost four days are gone by construction, not by a
better heuristic. A message either produced a `user` echo and a `result`, or it
did not, and the difference is a field in a JSON object rather than the shape of
a terminal at a moment.

**One process per turn, not one per conversation.** A long-lived process with
stdin held open is the better production shape -- it is the honest analogue of
the pane, and it takes a mid-turn message the way the input box does. It also
needs a supervisor that outlives the caller, which is a separate problem. This
resumes by session id instead, which Claude Code supports directly (verified:
`--resume` recovered a prior turn's reply in a fresh process), and serializes
turns on a lock file so the case the pane handled by queueing is handled here by
waiting. See `deliver` for what that costs.

**This is the Discord path.** `convcore.deliver` routes here as of 2026-09-17,
and no tmux session is involved in answering a Discord message any more. What
is left of the pane serves the dashboard's terminal card and carries no thread:
a pane and a thread deriving their ids from one value meant a Discord message
could start a second `claude` on the session a pane was already running, which
put a reply in the wrong thread the same afternoon. `tests/headless.py` is the
regression net.

    reads the transcript, so it cannot tell those apart. The fix is to try the
    other flag rather than to guess better, which is the same lesson as
    `transcript`: stop deriving what can be observed.

    Two ways to reach that state, one of them ordinary:

    - **Two messages to a brand-new thread in quick succession.** Both compute
      `--session-id` before either has run, serialize on the turn lock, and the
      second then collides with the session the first just created. That is a
      real Discord case -- a follow-up typed seconds after the first message on

      deploy watchdog when two probes drew the same second-resolution id.
