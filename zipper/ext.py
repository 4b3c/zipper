"""
Building and shipping the browser extension.

The extension is the one part of Zipper that runs somewhere this box cannot
reach: a browser on their desktop. Everything else is deployed by editing a file
here and restarting a service. This is the seam, and it needs a real path across
it or the extension quietly drifts a version behind the engine it talks to.

Three facts shape the design:

  * Release Firefox will not permanently install an unsigned extension, so a
    build is an upload to AMO and a signed `.xpi` coming back.
  * An installed `.xpi` is a copy inside the browser profile. Pulling this repo
    on the desktop changes nothing the browser will ever read.
  * `update_url` lives *inside* the manifest, so it is covered by the signature.
    It has to be right before the first signing, not added afterwards.

So: `zipper ext build` bumps the version, signs, and writes both the `.xpi` and
an update manifest into `data/ext/`, which the dashboard serves over the tailnet
at `/ext/`. Firefox polls that URL on its own schedule and installs what it
finds. Shipping a change becomes one command here and nothing at all there.
