"""zipper.runqueue

The queue, and the bookkeeping pass over it.

There is **one** queue: `Inbox/feed.json`, an append-only stream of typed events
that happened outside the vault -- a push, a Canvas submission, a calendar
change. Each row carries a `kind` and, where one can be resolved, a `target`
note, so working through it is a matter of reading rather than inference. Rows
are ticked off individually and never re-appear.

Note edits are *not* rows. They are the working tree, read straight out of git
at bookkeeping time and cleared by committing -- git is the baseline, and there
is no second one. (There was, once: HISTORY.md, 2026-09-06.)

Flags are neither. They are conditions derived fresh from current state on every
run, so ticking one off is meaningless: it re-fires next run, and worse, looks
handled while the project it names keeps stalling. They are reported, never
queued.

`cmd_brief` renders all three into `Meta/Queue.md` -- the brief for a
bookkeeping pass; `cmd_fetch` pulls every input and ends by calling it. The
reading in between is not a command and cannot be one. `cmd_commit` ends the
pass by ticking the rows and committing the notes.

    The emit half matters as much as the fetch: queue rows *are* the diff

    a push lands in the data with nothing in the queue pointing at it. Rows are

    file up within a second -- so this works the same from a timer, from the

    A bookkeeping pass always starts here. The brief's whole claim is that it
    shows what is true *now* -- open events, an unreviewed diff, live flags --
    and rendering it over a stale fetch quietly breaks that: a push from an hour
    ago is missing, a submitted assignment still reads as due, and a flag fires
    or fails to fire on yesterday's data. Fetching separately made freshness a
    thing you had to remember; making it the first step of the pass makes it a

    The last of the pass's three steps -- fetch, reason, commit -- and the only
    other one that is a command. What happens in between is an agent reading
    the brief against the vault, which is why there is no `bookkeep` command:
    naming one would suggest the machine does the part it cannot do.

    **A pass always ends in a commit.** That is not tidiness -- it is what makes
    the next pass's diff mean anything. The note diff is defined as "changed
    since the last bookkeeping pass", and the only thing making that true is
    that the last pass left the tree clean. Skip the commit once and the diff
    silently becomes general backlog, which is how the tree came to hold five
    sessions' conclusions with nothing marking where one ended.

    Ticking and committing are therefore one step: they are two halves of the
    same claim, that everything in this pass has been looked at and its
    consequences written down.
