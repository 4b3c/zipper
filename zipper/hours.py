"""zipper.hours

The timesheet, as a ledger rather than a spreadsheet.

The spreadsheet stays the system of record -- it is what they copy into Workday
on Thursday nights, and an hour that never reaches it is an hour they are not paid
for. So nothing here replaces it. This module holds what has been *captured*
(told to Zipper, usually over Discord) and tracks how far each entry has got:

    pending    captured here, not yet in the sheet
    in_sheet   the extension has seen it in the sheet
    submitted  the sheet's Submitted column carries a date

`pending` is the only state that means someone still owes an action, which is
why it is the only one that raises a flag. Everything else is reporting.

The sheet is one tab per semester, so row positions never shift under an older
term, and the writer only ever has to understand the current one.
