"""zipper.google

OAuth against Google, and the two Sheets calls the timesheet needs.

The token lives on this box rather than in the browser, which is the whole
point of doing it here: the extension could only ever act while a tab was open
on the sheet, and hours arrive over Discord at times when nothing is open at
all. With a refresh token in `.env`, `zipper hours add` can put a row in the
spreadsheet the moment they say it.

No Google client library: this is three HTTP calls, and a dependency would be a
worse trade than the forty lines below.

Which kind of OAuth client decides how quiet this is. An Internal client (one
Workspace org) needs no verification and its refresh token does not expire. An
External client left in Testing works for its listed test users, but Google
expires their refresh tokens after 7 days -- publish it (unverified is fine for
a handful of users) or `zipper google --auth` becomes a weekly chore.
