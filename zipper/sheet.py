"""zipper.sheet

Reading and writing the timesheet through the Sheets API.

The tab is not a table. It is week blocks -- a `Week N` header carrying the
week's range and a SUM over the rows beneath it, then one row per session --
and a writer that ignores that shape would produce rows the totals never count.
Two details of their sheet decide everything here:

  * The Total column is a formula, `=C{row}-B{row}`, not a value. A row written
    with "5:30:00" in D would look right and stop tracking its own times.
  * A week header's total has *headroom*: Week 4 is `=SUM(D27:D35)` with rows
    only to 30. So the natural place for a new row is the next free row inside
    that range, where the total picks it up with nothing else touched.

The headroom is the whole reason this can be an append rather than a row
insert. Inserting shifts every row below and rewrites other weeks' formulas;
writing into a blank row inside an existing SUM range touches one row and can
be checked afterwards. When a week runs out of headroom this refuses rather
than guessing -- see `plan`.

Times go in as text ("1:30"), which Sheets parses into the same day-fraction it
already stores. The 24-hour-across-noon rule lives in `zipper.hours`, because it
is a fact about their sheet rather than about this transport.
