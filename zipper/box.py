"""zipper.box

What the machine itself is doing: CPU, memory, disk, uptime, and whether the
services are running the code that is checked in.

Reads `/proc` directly; psutil would add a dependency for five numbers. Every
number here is read at call time and cached for a few seconds; nothing is
written to the vault, because none of it is a conclusion about anything. It is
the box's vital signs, and a vital sign is only worth reading live.

The one judgement in this file is `stale`: a unit whose process started *before
the code it runs was last edited*. On 2026-09-17 exactly that combination --
`zipper-web` restarted thirty seconds before the change it needed -- cost an
afternoon, and nothing on any surface said so. Now something does.

**Against file mtimes, not the commit.** The first version compared the start
time to HEAD's timestamp, which is a different question and gets the common case
backwards: the normal order here is edit, restart, verify, commit, so HEAD lands
seconds *after* a restart that already picked the change up, and every commit
lit the flag on a process running exactly the right code. Committing changes no
code. Editing does.

    a service starting up genuinely pins the core for about that long. It is
