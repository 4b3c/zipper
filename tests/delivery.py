"""Does a message actually reach a conversation?

    python3 tests/delivery.py

**The one path in this system whose failure is silent.** A lost message produces
no error, no log line and no missing file -- just a thread that never answers.
Every other bug here announces itself; this one is indistinguishable from Claude
taking a while. So it is the one path that cannot be checked by reading the code,
and until this file existed it never was: a refactor on 2026-09-16 was verified
by importing the module and running `zipper conversations`, neither of which
delivers anything, and it silently ate three messages in production.

What it asserts
---------------
Delivery is measured the only honest way -- `convcore._user_rows`, the count of
user messages in the session's *own* transcript. Claude's record that it
received something is a different kind of fact from a screen capture, and the
three bugs in this path (2026-09-07, -09, -10) were all cases of the screen
saying yes while the transcript said nothing.

The negative case matters as much as the positive ones. A delivery path that
cannot fail is not passing, it is lying, and "reported ok over a message that
never arrived" is the exact shape of every bug this file exists to catch.

Safety
------
Nothing here touches a real conversation.

- **Thread ids are `local-selftest-*`.** The Stop hook skips the `local-` prefix
  (`hooks/forward_reply.py:230`), so a reply from a test conversation is never
  posted to Discord. This is the existing fallback namespace, not a new one.
- **The working directory is a sandbox**, not the vault. `convcore.VAULT` is
  repointed for this process only, which moves both the session's cwd and its
  transcript directory, so a test conversation cannot edit notes and its
  transcripts do not land among the real ones.
- **Sessions are closed and their registry rows deleted** at the end, pass or
  fail, so `zipper conversations` is left exactly as it was found.

It does start real `claude` processes and does spend tokens -- a few hundred per
case. That is the price of testing delivery rather than testing a mock of it.
